# fun-with-chatbots

This is me messing around with SpringAI and OpenAI chatbots.
Using Tailwind and HTMX for the front end.  Needs the usual environment variable with api key, so set that.

All this was derived from from Dan Vega's yt project.  I should have just forked it, but wanted to build from scratch.
